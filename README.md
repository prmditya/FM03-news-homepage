## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript

### What I learned

In this project I learned about react, and also using typescript. There's a problem when I'm making the navbar and in this project I think it's still not very good because the responsiveness isn't that good.

### Continued development

In this project maybe in later I will continue to developt the responsiveness.
